# 🗂️ Eisenhower Matrix Task Manager

## 📌 Overview
The **Eisenhower Matrix** (also called the **Urgent-Important Matrix**) is a productivity tool that helps prioritize tasks by urgency and importance.  
It divides tasks into **four quadrants**:

1. **Urgent & Important (Do First)** → Critical tasks that require immediate attention.  
2. **Not Urgent but Important (Schedule)** → Long-term goals and tasks that matter but don’t need instant action.  
3. **Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)** → Interruptions or quick tasks that can be delegated.  
4. **Not Urgent & Not Important (Eliminate)** → Time-wasters that can be minimized or avoided.  

This project is a **simple web-based app** that lets you add tasks into their quadrants and manage them visually.
